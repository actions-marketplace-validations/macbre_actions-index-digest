GitHub Action for running [`index-digest`](https://github.com/macbre/index-digest) that **analyses your MySQL queries and schema** and suggests indices and schema improvements.

With this Action you can easily **implement database performance regression testing in your continuos integration pipeline**.

## How to use it

We assume that you have a MySQL up and running in your CI pipeline. Your tests suite runs using this database and SQL queries log is collected.

Given your MySQL test instance (and the optional SQL queries log) you can simply add this Action to your pipeline:

```yaml
    - name: Install and run index-digest
      uses: macbre/actions-index-digest@...
      with:
        index-digest-version: "1.4.0"
        index-digest-dsn: "mysql://test_user:test_password@127.0.0.1:3306/test_db"
        index-digest-report-file: "./report.yml"
```

> Here we assume that MySQL uses `test_user` with `test_password` credential for `test_db` database. And that the MySQL server runs locally listening on a default port (3306).
